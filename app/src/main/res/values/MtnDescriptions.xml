    <string name="Marcy"><p>Mount Marcy at 5344 feet, is the highest point in New York State. It is a popular destination for hikers due to its stature and great views, and the peak can get very crowded in the summer months. The mountain is located in the heart of the Adirondack High Peaks Region in the High Peaks Wilderness Area.</p>
        <p>The majority of the mountain is forested, although the final few hundred feet is above tree line. The peak is dominated by rocky outcrops, lichens, and alpine shrubs. There are two plaques at the top commemorating the centennial of the climb as well as the mountain summit itself.</p>
        <p>The shortest and most frequently used hiking route up the mountain is from the northwest, the Van Hoevenberg Trail, which starts at the Adirondak Loj near Heart Lake. From there it is about 7.3 miles to the summit, a nearly 15 mile round trip hike which can nevertheless be done in a very long day. This route has an elevation gain of over 3500 feet. There is a map below highlighting this route.</p>
        <p>Hikers starting up the Phelps Trail also known as the Johns Brook Trail from the overly popular Garden parking area in Keene Valley have a nine mile journey to the summit, and sometimes spend a night at Johns Brook Lodge (JBL) in the process. It is only 5.5 miles to Marcy from JBL, making the accommodation at the lodge very popular.</p>
        <p>A lengthier southern approach can be made from either of the two major trailheads for the southern High Peaks, Upper Works or Elk Lake.  Take a look below of a few videos of the hike to Mount Marcy and a few maps.</p>
